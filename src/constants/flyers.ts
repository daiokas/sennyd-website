    desc: 'JULIET FOX \nA penchant for driving, mesmeric techno has driven Juliet Fox’s evolution in recent years. Now based full-time in Berlin, Juliet seized the end of 2020 as an opportunity for growth, launching her techno label TREGAMBE which is currently an outpost for her own club- orientated productions. Meaning ‘three legs’ in English, fusing strength, integrity and authenticity, these defining traits are at the very core of the music her imprint showcases. Motivated to further personalise the label and utilise her passion for painting and exploring the relationship between art and sound, Juliet creates the artwork for each TREGAMBE release. The label launch follows a string of releases via prominent record labels Drumcode, Filth On Acid and Kraftek - all of which succeeded in bolstering her global profile with over *** mil Spotify streams. An energetic and motivated presence behind the decks, with a taste for high-impact tracks from techno’s formative years through to present-day, she’s gunning to return to the booth in 2021. After years of feeding ambitions to hit city after city and dive between continents, scoring off high-profile club gigs and festival pickings in the process, Juliet is excitedly anticipating that she’ll be spending more time in the German capital as night life returns, keen to be a part of a thriving local scene.',
